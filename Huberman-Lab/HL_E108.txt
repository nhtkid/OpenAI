Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Assess & Improve All Aspects of Your Fitness | Huberman Lab Guest Series
 Welcome to the Hubertman Lab guest series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Hubertman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today's episode marks the first in a series with Dr. Andy Galpin. Dr. Andy Galpin is a professor of kinesiology at Cal State University Fullerton and one of the foremost world experts on the science and application of methods to increase strength, speed, endurance, hypertrophy, and various other aspects of fitness, exercise, and sports performance. Across the six episode series, Dr. Andy Galpin pulls from his expertise working with everything from professional athletes to recreational exercises and teaches us the mechanisms, logic, and specific protocols for how to achieve any of the number of different exercise adaptations that I mentioned a moment ago, ranging from strength to endurance, hypertrophy, and everything in between. We get really far into details, but at all times paying attention to the macroscopic issues, that is how to create a program for endurance or strength or hypertrophy or speed or one that combines all of those. We also talk about supplementation and nutrition and how to maximize recovery for each of the different types of exercise adaptations. During today's episode, Dr. Galpin teaches us how to assess our level of fitness and more generally how to think about fitness so that we can best achieve our fitness, exercise, and performance goals. Dr. Professor Andy Galpin, super excited to have you here. You're such an immense treasure trove of information on physical training and optimizing for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise. I'm curious, however, so many people have different levels of fitness. Some people are professional athletes, of course, but most people are not. Many people exercise regularly. Some people are trying to do that more. Some people are doing too much of that. They're overtraining. They're not recovering enough. If we were to take a step back and each and every one of us ask, how fit are we with the word fit, of course, being a very broad and composing word, you know, could encompass endurance, certainly does strength, the ability to run fast, even if for short distances. It might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophy, trying to balance one's musculature to offset asymmetries, recover from injuries, etc. How should I or anyone else for that matter? Think about their level of fitness. I know my resting heart rate, but what do I do in terms of really assessing whether or not I'm as fit as I could be and should be, both for sake of health and performance. And here I'm asking you the question not as an athlete, but as somebody who's been pretty consistent as an exorciser, but if we were to throw our arms around this question of how do we assess our fitness? What would be sort of the different levels of assessment that we should think about and do? When it comes to exercise, people generally have two major goals in mind. Goal number one is achieving some sort of appearance. This is, I want to be big or want to not be too big or I want to be lean, something. It doesn't matter what that goal is, but there is an aesthetic component to almost everybody. They want to look a certain way or not look a certain way. The other one is functionality. So I want to be able to perform a certain way. Now again, that definition differs per person. So I want to be better at strength. I want to be better at mobility. I want to be able to have energy throughout the day. Whatever it is. So there's some sort of appeal to aesthetic and there's some sort of appeal to functionality. So within both of those categories, we want to be in a position where we can understand where do I need to go with my exercise training so that I can be as fit and as healthy and achieve these goals that I want now. So as well as being a position where I can maintain them for a long period of time. So this blends both immediate goals. So say you're just interested in squatting a lot of weight. So you're interested in running a 5K time the best you want. It doesn't matter. It blends that with the ability to desire to have a long wellness span to be fit throughout life to achieve all those things for as long as possible. So then the question kind of comes back to saying, how do I know which area I need to focus on the most and why am I not achieving these goals or how can I get there more effectively. And if we look at the big picture, we have to understand that there are several major components to physical fitness that are going to be required in all of these categories. And to achieve that, there are a handful of components that have to happen to be able to hit those goals. Now, there are infinite methods. So the saying we actually use here a lot is the methods are many but the concepts are few. So what I'd love to do today is over the course of our discussion is hit exactly what those concepts are and then cover a whole bunch of different methods and we could do that for hours. But we'll cover a number of them for various goals. So one of the reasons I went into neuroscience and not into exercise science is because of this thing neuroplasticity that nervous systems ability to adapt. But the more time I spend with you and the more I learn from you, I realize that many, if not all of the organ systems of our body have this incredible ability to adapt. And when we're talking about physical exercise, there are incredible adaptations that of course involve the nervous system but also involve muscle and connective tissue and so many other cell types and tissues. That said, when we talk about fitness, what are the major types of adaptations that underlie this thing that we call fitness. And later I know we're going to get into how different forms of exercise can trigger different types of adaptations. But what are the major adaptations that one can create in their body using exercise. There are many reasons why one should exercise and we could perhaps cover that later in our chats. But the physiological adaptations can be bucketed really in a nine areas. So the very first one is what I call skill or technique. So just learning to move better more efficiently with a specific position and timing and sequence or whatever that is, this could be running more effectively. This could be practicing a skill like shooting a ball or an implement swinging a golf club. Anything like that I call that skill development. The second one is speed. This is simply moving at a higher velocity or with a better rate of acceleration. That's very similar to the next one which is power and power is speed multiplied by force. The next one then of course on top of that is force or strength. Those are really synonymous terms, right. How effectively can you move something. Now this is often confused strength rather as muscular endurance. So what I mean by that is strength truly is a marker of how what's the maximum thing you can move or it's the maximum amount of force you can produce one time. It's not how many repetitions in a row you can do. That's actually another one of our adaptations called muscular endurance. That is typically under the order of like say five to 25 maybe 50 repetitions think of a classic how many pushups can you do in a row. I mean sit ups can you do in a minute like things like that are muscular endurance muscular endurance tends to be localized. So this is you know specific to just say your triceps and your and your deltoids. It's not a overall cardiovascular endurance marker or anything like that. So that's strength number four number five is muscle hypertrophy and this is the first time now we're talking about an appearance rather than a functional outcome. So you know moving better moving faster moving heavier or indicators of how well you can move. This is the first one that's just simply how big is your muscle and that's muscle hypertrophy or muscle size. After that is muscular endurance so this is how many repetitions you can typically do of a movement so think of how many pushups in a row you can do. How many set ups in a minute you can do things that are typically in like five to 50 repetition sort of range and it is often or it is almost always local muscle. So what I mean by that is it is I don't push up test is really how many reps that your triceps and pecs and and deltoids can do it is not a cardiovascular endurance it is not a global physiological endurance it's specific to typically one or a few muscle groups at a time. This is why you have to do multiple tests for a sort of every group there. After that now we moved into number seven which is what I call anaerobic capacity this is more synonymous with maximum heart rate and now we're actually looking at rather than a single movement or muscle group it is a total physiological limitation so it is the maximum amount of work you can do in say 30 to 45 seconds maybe even up to 120 seconds of all out work. Think of your classic interval type of stuff here so how much work can you do at a maximum rate where you're going to enter tremendous amounts of global fatigue. The next pass that is maximal aerobic capacity and this is probably something like in the eight to 15 minute range where you're going to reach probably both a maximum heart rate as well as a through VO to max which will talk a lot more about what that is later. So that is is a different from the previous one where you can't reach this in a matter of seconds it simply takes multiple minutes to get to a position to where your VO to max is actually going to be sufficiently challenged or an indicator there. And then the last one number nine is what I call long duration and this is just your ability to sustain sub maximal work for a long period of time with no breaks no reduction whatsoever this is often called steady state training or a lot of people just think of this when they think of a local cardio but your ability to continue move and without any breaks or change or drop is the last final adaptation and for long distance steady state. I'm guessing it exceeds 15 minutes because the previous one was eight to 15 minutes or so what sort of rate time ranges are we talking about in terms of this long duration. So that's actually wonderful you can be anything past 15 minutes so really if you look at a kind of a minimal number there's generally 20 minutes of what we're looking for but a more typical would be 20 to 60 minutes but anything past that was still be limited by your long duration endurance so your ability to sustain work over time. So given that there are nine different major adaptations that can be induced with exercise of specific types. Is there any one global test or assessment that people can take or do that allows them to determine what level of ability of fitness they have in each and every one of these nine different categories. And what I would actually like to do is walk you through my favorites for each and giving you both the scientific gold standard so if you had the ability on limited resources what should you go do as well as some that are our equipment free that are cost free things that anyone can do across the world in addition to that I want to walk you through what those numbers should be how do you identify if you really pour in something or if you're great and then if you aren't as good as you can. And then if you aren't as good maybe in a category you want to get better at it exactly what to do in terms of protocols for how to achieve the results in each of those steps so I know in your list of the nine different adaptations to exercise that you did not mention fat loss or health promoting benefits which are two reasons that a lot of people exercise was there specific reason that you did not mention those absolutely is because those things are actually not specific training styles. They are byproducts of these nine so what I mean by that is if you understand how fat loss occurs which we can certainly talk about you'll realize some of these nine protocols are effective for fat loss and some are not general health is the same thing when we understand what it actually means to be healthy from a physiological perspective then the rationale for what to train for is going to determine itself so what I mean is looking at things like in order to be healthy you have to have sufficient strength you have to have cardiovascular fitness you have to have sufficient muscle and etc. Therefore training for one's health is determined by those restrictions so for you Andrew you may need to do more strength training to be healthy where me because I'm strong already way stronger than you I may not need to do as much strength training so our quote unquote health based protocols are based on our current status or limitations in the body. So what I would like to do today is to cover a brief history of exercise science and the reason is it's going to explain a lot about why people are not getting the goals in their exercise programs that they want as well as give you very specific direction about what to do instead I can't wait to hear all the things that I'm doing incorrectly and to have you help me remedy that before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is also separate from Dr Galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton it is however part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is momentous momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality the human lab podcast is proud to be partnering with momentous for several important reasons first of all as I mentioned their supplements are of extreme. High quality second of all their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you're going to develop a supplementation protocol you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals in addition momentous supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the human lab podcast listeners reside outside the United States if you'd like to try the various supplements

sodium magnesium and potassium to optimize seller functioning for mental and physical performance most people realize that hydration is key we need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of ourselves and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios now of course people with pre hypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake but what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine if you exercise and in particular if you're falling a very clean diet that is not a lot of process foods which of course is a good thing chances are you're not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium

covers cover for about the last eight months and it has completely transformed my sleep I'm sleeping about the same amount but I'm sleeping far deeper and I'm now getting the proper ratios of so called rapid eye movement or REM sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically the underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature that is in order to fall asleep at night your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees in terms of core body temperature and waking up involves a one to three degree increase in core body temperature with eight sleep mattress covers you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night a different temperature the middle of the night and a different temperature as you approach morning each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever if you'd like to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dot com slash uberman and check out their pod three

checkout before we get into how the history of exercise and science informs the mistakes that we are all making and how to remedy those mistakes I'm curious as to whether or not you have any favorite one or two studies that point to a sort of naturally occurring example of how people can become very fit in one area and not another you know I'm familiar with seeing endurance athletes that apparently have terrific endurance but at least to my eye don't look like they are particularly strong I'm also familiar with seeing individuals that are very very strong particular social media but that don't look like they can walk up a flight of stairs much less run a mile do you have any examples of studies in or outside the laboratory that point to that in a concrete way there's a lot to have to discuss here but I'll answer it really clear if you look across the literature and this is actually back to as early as the mid 1950s in fact it actually goes back to previous to that the Harvard fatigue lab 1927 to 1947 area people actually were advocating at that point a combination of strength training and endurance in the 1920 way back then in fact actually goes prior that they late 1880s there's scientific evidence back then it became more well developed in the mid 1950s and 60s in fact there was the initial stages of what's called the exercise as medicine movement which is the movement now but the initial stages of that actually route back to the 1950s and I could actually go in that whole discussion and the story of how that all came about but that's the health as wealth mantra that came from the 1950s from the scientific community that all those those data points are going to suggest you need a combination of some sort of broad strength training and broad endurance now if you have a specific goal five months from now you want to compete in a race or hit a certain physique thing that's fine to focus on one area of training certainly if you're an athlete that's different but if you want to maximize health and overall functionality throughout time it needs to be a combination and to really really highlight this like I can actually talk about a couple of studies that I've done one of them we actually did in Stockholm Sweden so I did this at the careless institute which you probably are aware of it's actually one of the founding places of all of exercise physiology generally it started there it was called something different back then but really our entire field came out of Stockholm in that careless institute and we worked with a whole bunch of cross country skiers that were in their 80s and 90s and so they were competitive skiers the 1940s and 50s and they had been skiing competitively for that year duration so you're talking 50 to 60 consecutive years of competing so there's 80 to 90 year olds living alone and healthy and we compared them to a group of individuals here in America who are the same age but we're not exercising and what we wanted to do is to see and kind of look out what are these lifelong endurance individuals what do they look like when we brought them in the lab which is by the way amazing to do a test on a 92 year old especially in a language that they don't speak and you're in a you can imagine you're doing this in the hospital right and you're running people through this is a cycling test and so for a VO2 max test you have a mask on your face you hooked up to a metabolic cart so we can collect all the gases that are coming out of your mouth and you're chanting these people on and basically every minute the workload gets harder and harder and harder until you can't complete it and we're doing this in a cardiology center and the cardiologists are usually waiting for their heart rate to get like slightly elevated and they stop them because they're 85 86 years old and not only we not stopping them but we are screaming in their ears is like go go go and Swedish English English right and then the transit but it doesn't take a lot of translation when someone's screaming at your face like go go go so we ran them through a whole bunch of VO2 max test and we did the same thing for those folks back here in America and what was incredibly clear from that study was the VO2 max you can think about these numbers and this is what's called relative so in the relative terms are milliliters per kilogram per minute and so a standard number is about 18 is what we call the line of independence so if your VO2 max is below 18 milliliters per kilogram per minute it's very hard for you to live by yourself so your fitness is so low you probably are going to need to have you or you'll need to be in some sort of assisted living home so if you are in like VO2 max of 20 or 21 or 22 you're not below that line of independence but you're on that threshold and so what we found was our folks here in America the group average was right around that number so they were living at home by definition we pick them to be people living by themselves in their 80s not in a living but they didn't have any bandwidth so if they got a cold or they had anything pop up where they lost a little bit of fitness they were going to drop below that line and would probably have to go to some sort of assisted living situation the folks in Stockholm the the cross country skiers the group average was most closer to like 35 to 38 milliliters per kilogram per minute now that number is about the VO2 max you would find for a normal college mail and so these folks that were literally 80 or 90 if the you know the joke if a saber tooth tiger ran in the room or whatever and it chased it down and we all had to run at the see who didn't get eaten alive the college men would probably have gotten eaten before the 90 year olds and in one case we had a 92 year old individual and I think his VO2 max was 38 which was in our estimation a world record the highest VO2 max for somebody over the age of 90 and ask what is the typical resting heart rate for somebody very fit like these older Swedish cross country skiers if somebody has a this let's say their number is 35 milliliters per kilogram in this VO2 max test but since most of us don't have access to that kind of equipment but we can measure our pulse rate what was a typical resting heart rate resting pulse rate sub 60 yeah I mean typically that's a good number to go off of for anybody regardless of age anytime I see somebody above that I'm going to start asking questions certainly above you know you'll see in the literature people will say 60 to 80 is normal and I I don't agree that at all if you're up if you're resting heart is 75 beats per minute there's either something going on or you're not fit how much cross country skiing were they doing on average in the previous let's say if we take the previous 20 years since they've been long time cross country skiers divide that by 20 years yeah on average are these people cross country skiing five hours a day two hours day and hour a day yeah that's actually good question I don't remember it's been many years but they were not doing it every single day in that the volume would not have shocked you it was the consistency over 50 years that got them there now obviously these people were again world champions and Olympic gold medalist in 1940s and 50s so they were elite they just continued consistently over time but it wasn't a shocking amount of physical fitness they also didn't go out either way to train hard they were busy chopping wood they were busy doing number of other things and then they just happen to do some of these races and ski a long way but it wasn't a crazy amount to where you're like oh that's great but I could never hit that number it was something much more reasonable so is the take away to be consistent about getting cardiovascular exercise and we can define yeah what consistent means in terms of days per week a little bit later and I know we will yeah what are some other examples I love these examples of from the real world so here's the downside though so I only told you about the Viotomax what I didn't tell you about is the leg strength and functionality and that part was no more superior than it was their counterparts who were not exercises so what that showed really really clearly and many other studies have been done since then that look at the class what we call life long endurance exercise you will see in general their Viotomax the cardiovascular function their resting heart rate their blood pressure it will be markedly healthier than folks who don't exercise it is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise is very important for chronic disease management no doubt about it however it is not sufficient for overall global health because it does almost nothing for leg strength for any other marker of health which we can talk about what are the things that are actually going to predict mortality more debated the most so that was a big a big smashing indication that's like hey this is great however you're leaving things on the table for your overall health now one could argue they're 80 and they're doing pretty well but they weren't doing as well in these areas and so a study we did later actually as a follow up was the monos like a twins so this is actually interesting being a scientist this is a classic example of one of my graduate students who had been in my lab for probably three or four years and she was in our single fiber physiology lab and she's you imagine she's in she's isolating individual muscle fibers from an athlete one by one with the tweezers and she's going to do several thousand individual cells right so she's you're down there for hours and things happen down there you kind of and she was just kind of going on one day with one of my colleagues just talking and she's like oh yeah my uncle is really really fit and something or other and then oh yeah he's a twin and it's like oh is he monos like this and she's like yeah for those that don't know monos I guess are identical twin yeah what's interesting so you basically have what I'm setting up here is this is the perfect exercise scientific experiment monos like this identical twins mean you they have the exact same DNA so an egg was fertilized split and then two humans grew out of that with the exact same DNA and so now we can start to answer the question of well yeah okay what about maybe these cross country skiers maybe they were just genetic freaks maybe it didn't matter it's like some people have well genetics are always a component to it but how much well now we have a scenario lining upwards like wait a minute you have monos like us to win so we have a replica of a human being exact same DNA the only differences that we would see in their physiology now would be due to lifestyle circumstances interesting so monos like us to an aunt dad and uncle right huh great do they exercise well one of them does he's a lifelong endurance exercise runner cyclist swimmer iron man all these things what about the other one nope he doesn't at that point like I wanted to kill my graduate student because I'm like you've been in my lab for three years or more probably and you've never told me that in your household is the perfect scientific experiment for exercise you could ever create and like Jesus the look on her face when my colleague and I were staring at her Jesus like oh my god so I'm like call them right now they are coming in the lab to fly them in from Chicago I don't care what we have to do like we're getting them in and so I wanted to actually going back to the model that was first developed by the Harvard particular one thing that's interesting about that committee is they started off with the concept of trying to examine human performance through a holistic lens and so it was the antithesis of looking at either organ by organ so we're going to only look at the cardiovascular system or only going to look at the skeleton muscle and then we're saying we're looking at this entire picture and so that model we wanted to carry through when these twins and I said all right I want to bring them in the lab but I'm not just going to look at one system I want to do everything so we took stool samples we took blood we did vertical jump tests we did maximum strength test we did MRIs of muscle mass we did we did a VO2 max test we did efficiency stuff we did today testing we did an IQ test we did psychological battery we wanted to look at everything to figure out all of these things what different between the twins and if so the second key question there is by how much so can I improve my VO2 max sure everyone knows that but how much can it change by 5% 80% like where is the number and so putting some quantification on this was very important and so again we had another example of a classic endurance only training paradigm compared to a non so this is a person who's in the truck driver by vocation which is I think you actually drove for a potato chip company which was even fun here the endurance act they actually was great because like any endurance people he had a he had physical books of all of his training mileage for the last 35 years and we could we just went through them we calculated the total amount of miles he ran his averages his heart rates per time we had this unbelievable thing like what race is he was in he had the documentation it was just totally nuts like something that endurance people are like shaking their head right now going oh yeah I got that too and I was just saying endurance folks are pretty nerdy yeah super nerdy right so it's great because now we could validate as close as one could to actually how much you ran and things like that so they had about a 35 year discord they both exercise up through high school about 18 they stopped doing it by the time they read them in the lab there in the mid 50 so it was about 35 years difference and when we ran them through the testing if you look at the the measures that were similar to the Sweden study it was almost identical the the the exercising twin was significantly better at things like a lipid panel resting heart rate blood pressure via two max any of those markers as predicted were much better what was very interesting though was the things that were in the middle first of all their total amount of muscle mass was almost identical like to the gram within the margin of error of a dexoscan could possibly ever be the non exercise or though was a little bit fatter so the difference in actual body weight was explained almost entirely by body fat or non lean tissue really same sort of joke so okay like no one surprise there that the exercise was a little bit lean or even know it didn't change the amount of muscle mass at all when we looked at some of the more functional tests and we looked at things like muscle quality so this is a metric you can get from an ultrasound you can kind of think about this as how much fat is inside the tissue which is sometimes an advantage for endurance athlete to have a little bit more of an what are called the muscular directorized because it's a fuel directly in the tissue but in general the exercise or the muscle quality was not in favor of the exercise if you looked at the performance testing and if you looked at strength it favored the non exercise so now again we have the same finding we saw in our Sweden study but in identical twins so it really really highlighted the fact that if you want to move forward with optimal health simply picking one silo is not going to get you there one silo meaning just running just cycling right does this mean that the twin that did not exercise could jump higher or win an arm wrestling competition not that that's a vital thing to be able to do but just in terms of measuring strength you know it's our isometric strength was the non exercising twin stronger or at least as strong as they're exercising yeah particularly in grip strength yeah and any of the measures like the vertical jump like extension power and a number of things they often favored the non exercise which you're still a little bit of a chicken and egg you don't know necessarily the endurance training reduced that other twins strength or it doesn't even really matter per se I think the highlight of it is can you change some of these metrics of the metrics yeah not even close these things are very responsive regardless of your genetics your genetics will give you a starting place very clearly even the non exercise was a pretty healthy guy so they weren't a good spot mid 50s doesn't exercise doesn't really pay attention to pretty good shape however if you want to actually move progress and move for high functionality you have to do something besides just run just distance run now I could say the same thing for strength training that alone I don't want to make this thing like I'm saying under exercise it worked in both case built these studies those folks were much better off in metrics that are incredibly important to mortality how long you're going to live real to max etc it's just not going to get there in terms of strength we took a look at muscle fiber physiology as well which is very interesting so what I mean is there's generally two types of muscle fibers fast twitch and slow twitch and one of the things that is a small mark of aging is a selective reduction in fast twitch fibers and that's because it's difficult to activate them unless you're doing high force activities you're going to activate slow twitch fibers doing almost any activity of daily living and so they stay around fast twitch fibers unless you're doing something of high force or going not be used and they're not going to be kept around and that's a problem you've got things like the need for like strength through aging the ability to catch yourself from a fall these things are incredibly important if you don't have faster fibers you don't have the speed to get your foot out in front of you on time and you don't have the eccentric strength to stop the fall from happening and so if you look across again the aging literature they're very clear about the importance of maintaining strength and fast twitch fibers over time so we know that this is an important distinction here of role and people will often talk about okay how much of that is genetically determined can I change my fiber type and the answer there is is resoundingly yes and can I change it with exercise and the answer is absolutely you can and the next question is how much so now again we're going to see an attitude in general without going too far down an area that maybe because say for it for later each one of your muscles in your body has a different percentage of fast twitch and slow twitch for example your calf if you look at your soleus which is kind of the smaller one that goes in the back that's generally mostly slow twitch typically 80% or so slow twitch the gastroc which is the other one right next to it so if you're to point your toe next to your face in that part that kind of flexes out in the middle pops out that's your gastroc that is almost the inverse so it's generally 80% fast twitch maybe 20% slow twitch generally anything antipostero or postural rather anti gravity spinal directors things that are meant to keep you up or moving all day are going to be slow twitch and things like your hamstrings which are for explosion are going to be fast twitch well we buy up to the quad in these individuals and in that muscle it's generally about 50 50 fast twitch slow twitch as is a really broad number well one of the things that we found was in the non-actress exercise or it was almost textbook what you would predict it was about 50% or so slow twitch a little bit of percentage of fast twitch and about 20% or what are these called hybrid fibers which are a hallmark of activity great in the exercise or it was about 95% slow twitch and so it's extremely clear again I don't know if maybe their set point was a little bit higher towards that and the non-actressizer the you know devolve down to his place or the other one but it doesn't matter I mean you going from 40% slow twitch in one case to 95% slow twitch in another case it shows you that the the limits of physiological adaptation are darn near boundless given enough exposure in this case that's 35 years of extremely consistent training and his muscle morphology was completely different than his identical twin with the exact same DNA those are two beautiful examples of people doing endurance work for a number of years and what that gives them in terms of benefits and functionality the opposite experiment been done or observed where somebody just wait lifted or just sprinted for a number of years I don't know that there's a identical twin control that's a little I wish we had a third twin too much to ask for right triplets okay so triplets out there if you're exercising in different ways or people who have triplets maybe you assign one kid to be a runner when you have to be a weightlifter and the other one to be said and Terry please don't do experiments like that but the expectation as I understand it would be that the person that sprints or that does heavy squats explosive work would then have more fast twitch muscle fibers in their quad and their non-exercising counterpart would have fewer that that would make sense but what happens if you the endurance level in somebody who is just done strength training or just sprinted yeah so we don't have those data specifically there's we're actually just starting to have studies come out on life long strength trainers and there's actually a very good reason for this which is a whole story we can get into but the quick answer is we don't have a lot of people who've been lifting weights for 30 or plus years we have a whole swath of people who've been doing endurance training for that long is that because fewer people have been weight training or the weight trainers all dead you got to go back to the 1953 1954 you had two major things happen that change the entire course of exercise physiology and exercise science and really exercises we know it it's important to understand the history of our field a lot of the questions I get are based on false assumptions of what exercise can and can't do as an example we questions like momentum should I use momentum or that's cheating right or it doesn't work it compromises my results it's actually totally untrue there are excellent reasons when you should use momentum when you lift there are reasons when you should not it is sometimes very beneficial to go fast with the exercise repetition sometimes very slow and control this better any question I get in fact I'm very infamous for always responding with it depends the reason I say it depends is it depends on the goal when you're training for speed or power or muscular endurance the answer to some of these very common question differs what people fail to realize is they think they're asking the right question because they don't understand this history what's being planted in your brain subconsciously is driving that question it's not necessarily the right one so if we walk through that a little bit you'll see what that field has led you why you think certain things matter when they actually don't or maybe your assumptions are incorrect and then exactly what to do about them I'd like to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens athletic greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic greens daily since 2012 so I'm delighted that their sponsor of this podcast reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it covers my vitamins my minerals and the probiotics are especially important to me athletic greens also contains adaptogens which are critical for recovering from stress from exercise from work or just general life if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greens calm slash huberman to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2 again if you'd like to try athletic greens go to athletic greens calm slash huberman to claim the special offer so in 1953 1954 you had Roger Bannister breaking the four minute mile so sub four minute file and then you also had Mr Edmund Hillary and then his trip in Norway some at Everest in the same basically two years span that exact same year after that was a formation of what's called the American College of Sports Medicine now that is still around today it is a preeminent group for this exercises medicine so if you're interested in things like exercise for obesity prevention for cancer treatment for things like that it's not really sports medicine it's more for clinical exercise that's the place to go American College of Sports Medicine so we have this launching of both a ton of people wanting to start doing endurance exercise and start swimming and cycling and running and then you have a launch of people coming off of the back of the Harvard fatigue lab so the fatigue lab actually shut down in 1947 so you have these people interested in physical fitness but know where to go well all those people left the Harvard fatigue lab and started their own labs and other places so you've launched the careers of people like Dave Costell and John Halazi and some of these very famous exercise physiologists and they start building laboratories and we start for the first time ever studying the science of exercise so years go by and these people happen the 1960s and 1970s what we call the runners boom so people start if you fact if you look at the numbers of people who are doing marathons it explodes through these two decades spans right because it's like the we could do these endurance feats notice both those feats were endurance right running short term as well as going over there no one has thought anything about strength training and here's why in the late 1880s there was a very famous physician a Georgia windship I think was his name who was a big proponent of strength training well he died in like in the age of 50 something of a heart attack and that terrified people of strength training for 70 years because they're like whoa that stuff will kill you because he was a doctor he was trying to run around the country doing these exhibitions and reporting it and then he died it's sort of like atkins 100% dying all that some people say he died of a heart attack other people said he fell through the ice into cold water that's debated but the fact that a heavy proponent of a given nutrition plan dies suddenly not good for business so now the little storm is brewing 1940s and I'm going back a little bit but bear with me for a second there's a guy named Peter Carpenter and he's a scientist out of Springfield like the decorated physical education PE like that's a legendary play at Springville College and he is anti strength training for a lot of the same reasons and his entire career talked about this he's the one that launched these ideas that strength training will make you lose flexibility it will be bad for kids like all these things that we know now are clearly not true he's proponent of these things and there's a show that happened in his at Springville College and a guy named Bob York and if you York Barbell that's still around today is going around the country and putting on these exhibitions they come to Springfield and it's sort of like a new aged like social media thing where it's like the students know what's about to happen because Carpenter shows up to this event and everyone knows he hates strength training and everyone is like waiting for it to end just to see what he's going to say so this whole exhibition goes on these people are doing now you got to remember back in the time like body building weightlifting power lifting strength strong man it's like all the same thing there's no differentiation yet and it finishes and Carpenter which stands up and like the crowd goes silent and he just asks one question he just points to one of the guys and says scratch your back and now he's just assuming and waiting for the guy to be like a not be able to put his hand behind a set and I think he pointed to John gimmick who's like a famous bodybuilder and he reached back and scratched his back no problem and then they proceeded to grab two dumbbells I think they were 50 pound dumbbells and do a back flip standing back flip with both in each hand they start doing the splits on stage and they start going performing all kinds of physical function test and Carpenter which is stunned he's like holy shit he has nothing to say he leaves there in his whole life has changed all these things he was claiming were shown in his face to be false he does a 180 on his career he starts running study after study on strength training and starts finding it immediately there are no detriments to strength training in terms of like global health right of course you can do it wrong and things like that in fact here comes a whole bunch of benefits so through the 1950s while this things going on with the endurance folks no one's still strength training because there's no there's no record to see there's no American college of sports medicine there's no societies there's no science we're not sure it's safe and meanwhile Carpenter is just hammering study after study after study showing you it's safe it's safe it's safe but it hasn't picked up yet and then everything changed in 1977 thank you Arnold Schwarzenegger he came out with the trifle he hits you with pumping iron which I know you know that movie right pumping interesting movie even for those not interested in bodybuilding it's a very interesting movie because it really gives a window into not just him but the way in which weight training started to show up as a regular practice you know I when I was growing up the only people weight train were people preparing for football bodybuilders who basically didn't exist in the time where I grew up and the only people who did yoga were like yogis doing bichram but now you drive through any major American city or European city and there is yoga studios there's gyms with free weights yep Arnold Schwarzenegger is largely responsible I think for it for initiating that that shift yep he could see he think about it he hit us with pumping iron Conan and then the terminator almost in back to back like very close within years so you've got this whole cascade of the 70s of people running cycling and swimming now science is starting to come out that it's not dangerous and maybe actually some benefit and then boom not only is it not bad for you it can make you into a real world superhero I mean think about the psychology of a child growing up watching somebody like Conan think about what Batman looked like in the 1950s or 60s right and then boom I can look like that not everyone wants to look like Arnold but you see like you see the power that can land and people no one had ever seen or thought you can make your body transform like that you could maybe be born like that but no chance that's within the grasp of all of you when I was a kid growing up one of my favorite books was the Guinness Book of Worlds records still have images in my mind of the the coldest animal you know the longest lifespan etc. you know and there was a picture in there of Arnold Schwarzenegger and you know what his record was it said perfectly developed man yeah yeah which is as you point out that isn't the physique that most people aspire to but it really I it did inspire this the ship the other thing about resistance training that I think has a certain allure for some people men and women is that it's one of the few forms of exercise that because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscle that occurs during the training the so-called pump it gives you a transient but somewhat real window into what your results will be 100% you know when you run and you're gasping for air you don't get this you aren't experiencing what it's like to be faster than you are that day when you wait train you get an aesthetic picture into how your functionality and aesthetic will change it disappears a few hours later sure as the so-called pumps of subsides but it's a very interesting form of exercise in that way it's almost as if you go into learn a language and during the process of learning for brief moments you're actually fluent and then it gets taken away yeah it sort of puts the dopamine carrot out in front of you yeah this is just me hypothesizing as to why weight training might have taken off the way that it did like if you got paid every hour on the hour when you're working and then at the end of the day like they take the money back but you still like as the time clock is going on in your day you're looking up and you're just seeing why you're watching your bank account grow in real life like you can see why it's so addicting to those folks so to finish the story here what going back to your actual question to answer it this is happening the late 70s early 80s and so now Joe Weeder all these gems they're exploding because people want to look like that or they have they realize they have a chance to change how they physically look that had never been a reality before mostly men at that point are not exclusively yeah for a large number of reasons cultural acceptance etc even with endurance stuff you could get fitter and run faster and that's better but it wasn't going to change how you looked unless you were losing fat now you can change how you look which is so incredibly dicking fact there's a very famous quote I think it was actually Joe Weeder who said show me one man who wants to be strong and I'll show you ten and want to look strong right it's like that's very very powerful right there's this is a whole like there's tons of this history I can go into which is sort of explaining to you but now you're in the mid 80s and you have what I call my generation so you have my generation who fall in love with strength training in the 18 in the in the 1980s and 90s but there's really no scientific field for it it's not really come about yet the science of endurance and exercise physiology is now humming along at a massive rate because these people came up in the 70s and 80s and they're five 10 15 years in their career they're producing they're generating graduate students they're starting their own labs and the exercise physiology still to this day is 80% endurance steady state stuff almost exclusively well now my my generation you love you love sports you love lifting you all of all these things and now what we see happen is the Chicago Bulls Michael Jordan starts picking up strength training who that's on TV he's on sports center in the mid 1990s lifting weights and we go back actually to the late 1970s and I'm not sure if you're a football fan but any football fan will recognize the Nebraska cornhousekers in the 1970s in 80s change how football's played well the reason is because they started strength training and they started doing it with a guy named Boyd Eppley who was the founder of the NSCA so the National Strength and Edition Association is formed in the late 1970s as well so just like ACSM was developed the year after those two events happened 1978 the year after Arnold comes out boom NSCA is formed and now you have a scientific organization dedicated to strength and conditioning you've got NFL strength and conditioning coaches that are starting to come on board you've got scientists that are starting to come into labs and strength and conditioning becomes a scientific field well everything swings now from an exercise perspective into bodybuilding and so almost all of the things in fact we were sort of talking before I could run a whole bunch of tricks on you and I could ask you a whole bunch of questions about things that you think are absolute standards or guaranteed about training I'm supposed to do this I'm never supposed to do that for instance is it okay to train a muscle group on back-to-back days most people are at home thinking no you're not supposed to train a muscle group and that's total nonsense other things like body parts split training training one muscle group per day other things like cardio endurance training influencing will it ruin my gains from my lift all of these things are on at a base of assumptions that come from bodybuilding now that's a fantastic world but because everything started in the late 1970s as bodybuilding in terms of basically strength training was that weightlifting and powerlifting were not at all around they were but nobody cared again show me someone who wants to be strong I'll show you 10 and want to look strong the physique thing just dominated and we're not getting out of that yet we're not all the way out of it we're starting to though because here's why people started to realize this bodybuilding thing is fantastic I can change my physique I'm getting better but damn these workouts take an hour and a half two hours and I'm going to spend that whole time on one or two body parts which means I'm going to have to lift six days a week and I'm going to have to do that consistently right now I said boom two hours on my on my elbow flexors damn my elbow starting to hurt and yet my understanding is that it doesn't really require two hours a day not at all training in order to get benefits even just for hypertrophy totally but a lot of the times you're going to have to get some amount of time in because you're spending so much isolation so we've gone away from training movement running as a movement cycling as a movement training my biceps is a muscle muscle group training my hamstrings are a muscle group that's not a human movement so we've done a 180 in terms of selecting the exercises from movement-based prescription to now muscle group based training so when you're isolating muscle groups that means a whole chunk of your body is really not doing much throughout the day so what happens if you're doing say legs on Monday and you miss Monday because you're on a flight now your legs have to wait a whole nother week that's the social that bit so this has become problematic people start getting beat up people start realizing actually don't feel that great I'm not super fit I'm sweating just walking up the stairs I'm out of breath why because all that training you've done nothing for your cardiovascular fitness you've done nothing to improve heart rate oxygenation blood flow and so that paradigm swing way too hard into the exercising especially lifting weights is single joint often machine often slow often high volume isolation so and that left a giant opening of people going well wait a minute what if you could get in the gym I could promise you the same or better result in under 30 minutes and in fact you also feel better you'll lose more weight and that opened up group exercise classes kettlebell stuff crossfit type of stuff circuit training because you can come in you won't get so beat up because of volume slower the time is much lower you get multiple adaptations at the same time great the problem with that though fast forward 10 years is it started burying people because you've now de-emphasized movement quality and you've overemphasized scores right so this is a classic example if you go and you watch pumping iron you'll see or anybody will you'll see if they're doing a bicep crew they don't even really pay attention to the rep range they don't really pay attention to the load they are looking at their muscle they're trying to figure out how do I get that thing to fire they're squeezing their flexing their posing at the end of every set they're trying to figure out am I getting enough pump it is exclusively founded on exercise quality the rep range the numbers almost irrelevant when you go to the other model exercise technique it doesn't matter just get the most amount of weight up or the amount of reps or the fastest time etc etc high intensity I've walked past some cross fits you as I've done two cross fits I don't want to see you said crossfit I didn't I enjoyed them I definitely felt like I was working hard I observed a lot of people in very close proximity doing Olympic lifts and doing kipping that's where you kick your legs folks say you know sort of like bucking and kipping type pull ups no I enjoyed it it wasn't for me for the long term but it did seem that there was a lot of ballistic movement in close proximity to other people so the hazard to me seemed more about that than the actual movement well again the the point I'm setting up here is that was actually a really brilliant solution for a lot of the problems the classic bodybuilding hypertrophy introduced so it got away from isolation movements and got people doing big movements which are more effective generally better it got people doing things fast and explosive that's more athletic that is more important for longevity it solves a lot of the problems joint health wasn't getting crashed the issue they went with is they just pushed the pace on score rather than quality they pushed the pace on how many people can be in here at the same time so now you're doing higher risk movements higher intensity higher fatigue and with a total not that they don't care about technique but it's not the thing that they're most concerned about it's getting the number and the thing done they solve the time issue though you can get tremendous results in three days a week under 45 minutes each session etc burn people out though way too much high intensity way too often and the other problem safety concerns all kinds of orthopedic issues and other stuff can i interrupt you for a moment just ask a question as we go through this arc of the history of why endurance training predominated or strength training or bodybuilding type training or crossfit type training because i think this is fascinating i know we're about to arrive at where we are today and what the future looks like for for people and what they should focus on and do at what point if any do you think resistance training started to become adopted by women you know there was no equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger there was Linda Hamilton in the terminator yeah there are some impressive physiques certainly on female actresses and athletes the Williams sisters you know very impressive musculature and physiques and of course their tennis playing speaks for itself has that happened yet i mean what i mean is do you think since you work with both men and women yeah do you think that most women understand that weight training done properly is going to be extremely beneficial for them maybe even especially for them in terms of offsetting bone density loss and things of that sort or we still waiting for the stimulant the popular stimulus for getting you know 80 percent of young women thinking i want to lift weights yeah hard for me to answer because i'm not like i'm not a woman right now i have a daughter she's four so we'll see what i can say is i've probably worked with i don't know how many professional athletes in total a lot i've worked with them probably 14 professional sports i've worked with say young winners MVP's like the whole all the credentials right i bet 35 40 percent of the athletes i've worked with our female so i've worked with the limpa gold medalist i've worked with bronze medalist in multiple sports i've worked with the most decorated power lifter of all time so in a number of these areas fighters world championship all these things from me i feel like that versus already happen my students if you look at my classroom i don't know what the numbers are but there is no small number of females in exercise science and exercise physiology if you look at our laboratories that's one thing you will see there are very few female exercise scientists there are very few female stringed editioning coaches but that number is is is coming down to astronomical right you have people that are being hired in every sport you pick the NFL you pick major league baseball every every few months we're hearing first female hired for this first female hired for that the Yankees Rachel Rachel back of it's fantastic you know yeah Rachel's been out to my lab she's terrific yeah yeah yeah that's that she's fantastic I mean she's now being hired as the I think she's a hitting coach now actual sport coach she's gonna be a jam like that's this her goal she's a terminator so that's already happening and my students that are coming through our program are getting placed in these roles they haven't gotten through yet a lot in terms of being an actual scientist but they're getting there some more scientists in the NBA being hired females in terms like big data collection and sports science and tech will cover you know and another discussion but I think it's happening whether or not the cultural and social I can't speak to that any of the equation what I can speak to though is one of the things I think is most fun coming forward scientifically is you know a number of years ago and I came back through with their mandates of saying it's no longer acceptable to exclude women from scientific research right because we just did that for decades well what happened I just to fill this in because I think it's worth noting is that for many years studies even on rodents yeah we're mainly carried out on male rodents because the assumption and the assumption turned out to be wrong but the assumption was that the physiology of female rodents because they don't have a menstrual cycle it's not 28 days they have an ester cycle it's four days a different type of cycle that that would somehow disrupt the data turns out that's entirely wrong now it's actually required when you sit on a grant study panel which are the people evaluate grants you they ask they literally say did they meet the criteria for sex as a biological variable here we're not too much sex as the verb or time as sex biological sex and if you don't say yes that's a strong hit against the grant and if you say yes then it checks off that box so it's now required to both male and female rodents and humans be studied in a given study unless the study is specifically geared toward understanding that only exists in one or the other population such as menopause for instance yeah menstrual cycle andropause for instance but but this is extremely important I'm excited to hear that so where where I was going to go with that is actually so that was step one which is cool you got to include where we haven't gotten to yet but I've seen more and more grant applications come through for this it's just the funding hasn't yet which is it's one thing to end the let women be in the same studies that's great it's another thing though to start performing high performance research specifically for female questions that has not happened yet and that's just like a funding issue right we haven't gotten money yet people aren't supporting that we don't get a lot of financial support for sports science but we can't track down the money yet if someone go me going I want to do a study in female athletes say I have female athlete questions these won't help men these are questions specific to the female that's the next step right that's where we got to get to so we can say maybe we should do things differently around training recovery or or we shouldn't or it doesn't matter there's some there's a handful of not lower quality but like some studies I don't love them yet there's just needs to be a ton of work birth control is a very good example right the the information for women at female athletes or even just like hard exercises you don't have to be competitive athlete around what is birth control doing what types how should I manage that what conversations should I be having with my doctor almost nothing like women have nothing to go on for high performance so what if I'm trying to compete in an event or run a race how like all those types of questions should be answered normative value normative data performance testing like it's just not there on the female so that's an area I think like if somebody really wanted to make a change that the scientists want to do it I know I talked to so many in our field that would really love to explore it because it's getting there the like I said the coaching side is getting there they're seeing that they're hiring these people I'm looking at my students you know my following is not all men like it's a very large percentage of females and all I do is post about exercise science and like this is all I do so well this podcast is very we know very clearly the audience is 50% women 50% men that's right which is great so just to jump back in our history discussion and to finish that point of where we're at now and where I am going to go should go so we walk through the body building kind of running everything and people walking into a gym anytime they lift weights they're they're making all their choices based in the assumption that maximizing muscle size is the goal and clearly that's not the case there are other adaptations you may be after so we talked about how that had problems and we talked about how some of these other forms of exercise filled those gaps and then what problems those things introduced well I think we're actually at a point where that pendulum is kind of slowly shifting into the middle what I mean but that is if you want to maximize muscle strength we look towards the power lifting community if you want to maximize muscle power we're going to look for the weight lifting community if you want to look for muscular endurance well routed is maybe we look into the crossfit communities and some of these obstacle course races or functionality things so what we can do now is generate protocols that get us the exact adaptations we want and not ones we don't want because we can look back at each of these different styles of training and pick and choose optimal protocols or combinations for them so somebody simply wants to get healthy like we talked about when we listed the nine adaptations and I mentioned health wasn't one of them that's because what determines your health versus what determines my optimal health differs so if I need more hypertrophy I can look towards bodybuilding concepts but if I have enough or maybe for personal reasons I decide I have too much or I don't want to add any more than I can say hey how can I get stronger without getting bigger and more my look towards power lifting concepts how can I get more powerful how can I get faster but I don't you know again want to lose fat okay great or if I want physique changes so we have all these different areas we can pick and choose from that have expertise in specific adaptations and develop ourselves perfect protocols based on that information I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker as a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your media and long term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there however is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors etc but you don't know what to do with that information inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are of course but then also what sorts of behavioral dos and don'ts what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try inside tracker you can visit inside tracker dot com slash huberman to get 20% off any of inside tracker's plans again that's inside tracker dot com slash huberman to get 20% off so with the understanding in mind as to how we all myself included arrived at such lopsided fitness too much endurance not enough strength too much strength not enough endurance that's really hard to imagine that anyone's perfect in this regard can you walk us through the nine different adaptations that you mentioned earlier and give us a way to assess our level of ability or our level of adaptation in each of those nine. Alright the very first one we want to talk about is movement skill now set aside sport specific so I'm not going to give you an assessment for optimal golf technique swing is this really about human movements that you stay injury free and you can continue to train for as long as possible so what are the minimum requirements now if you can have access to a highly qualified physical therapist or movement specialist that's the best route right go to them have them identified all of your movement patterns overhead pressing squatting running all these things that's your gold standard if you want to do it yourself though here is a very simple four step solution so the way that I it teaches is I go joint by joint and so I think it's just as the major ones your shoulder your elbow your low back hip knee and ankle okay now what you can do is do a representative movement for you so if you bench a lot use the bend if you do pull ups use the pull up if you squat do that I would recommend doing an upper body press an upper body pull a lower body press lower body pull an example would be a push up a pull up or a bent row a squat and then a deadlift that would be a very very well-rounded approach what you're going to do is do that movement and I would record it for yourself and record a frontal view and a side view probably do three to ten repetitions per angle okay slow and controlled you don't need any body weight what you want to do is move and you want to look for four key things at every joint alright so I can get imagine I'm doing a squat I'm going to do a squat and I'm going to focus on just my ankle and I'm going to look for these four things at the ankle and then I'm going to go back and watch my knee and look for these same four things the knee to the hip etc all right so what are these four things number one is you want to look for symmetry so symmetry is front to back left to right and your right limb and your left limb right and so what we want to look for are if they aren't moving perfectly that's fine but you want to see is one moving further ahead than the other one is one turning to the side one's not is one fidgeting and and twitching around differently so you want to look just to check to see and make sure that they're stable that's one number two you want to look for stability so key indicators here are things like if you if you can't can through a a squat a controlled squat where your knees don't start shaking like that would be an instability issue so can you do the movement slow can you pause at the bottom maybe three seconds maybe five seconds or ten you should have complete control of that movement at all of these joints are your hips sliding to one side when you stand up is one elbow closer to your body when you're benching and the other ones more flare out these are the things I'm talking about right I'm not worried about what angle they should be at or not you're simply looking for asymmetries or instabilities all right so again as you're pushing up does one elbow start flipping and twitching and going all over the place the third one is what I call awareness so there are a lot of movement technique issues that are simply people don't know and so you'll watch them squat I do this in my classes all the time I'll have a hundred kids out there squatting and you'll see some horrible squat technique and then when you just tell them hey did you realize your heels are supposed to be on the ground or all times in your squat like oh okay and they can correct it's not actually movement flaw it was just simply an awareness I didn't know and then I actually didn't realize that that was happening that position so we want all of our joints to be going through a general full-range emotion which is number four so the ankles during like a squat your knee should be able to go as far over your toes possible while maintaining good position your feet flat on the floor your you know three points of contact your whole foot foot and you're not compromising another joint so that's all you're going to look for those four things symmetry stability awareness and range of motion through each joint through each movement it sounds difficult and time consuming it's really not right you can generally kind of clear these things in one or two repetitions in a couple of seconds and what you're really going to look for there's lots of scoring schemes you can you know test the physical therapist or you I just look for absolutely terrible like can't do it at all minor flaw or pretty close to good that that's really all I'm looking for so my scoring system is zero one three zero is like you're not going to do this exercise because you're at a very high acute risk you might get hurt on rep one tomorrow number one score of one is like there's a minor flaw here we can probably do it but we need to be cautious of load and volume the other one is maybe it's perfect maybe it's not but go ahead and sort of do it on a reasonable protocol you'll be fine so that's generally what you would need to do is a cost-free method of identifying good movement technique within any of the things that that you would do what about speed I actually don't think this is one most people should test if you're a high performance athlete we can run a 40 yard dash or we can do some different things with a velocity trans to surround a barbell if you're weightlifter or something for most people pure speed is really maximum velocity or acceleration or kind of the two ways we break it down it's not just it's just doing not that necessary to test what about number three power which I believe before you told me was speed times force so the reason why I don't worry too much about speed is because you can infer a lot of it from a power test and a power test is easier to do as well as easier to train for for most people so the the cost-free version here is a simple broad jump so this is stand with normal position jump out as far in front of you should possibly can and measure the distance between where you started and the back of your heel where it lands a super basic number to look for there is your height so you should be able to broad jump how tall you are if you're five foot five you should have five five six foot five etc it's not perfect that's going to ratchet down a little bit about 15% for females they just simply don't have the power in general that men have and so you're going to want to bring that down a little bit but that's a it's a very crude number if you were to look at like a high performance NFL player if they're six feet tall they're going to be jumping like nine to ten to eleven feet if you can jump your body height we're not looking for optimization in this particular test what you are looking for red flags if you can jump your body height you're going to be just fine that's incredibly straightforward and yet I have one question yeah I'm assuming that I can squat down as low as I need to before I jump I can swing my arms from back to front as harder with as much momentum as I can muster and when I land you said I'm going to take the measure from where the back my heels you want to measure the distance you actually covered so to clarify there's no running approach here there's no steps into it you're going to stand at a still yeah you can swing bounce as much as you'd like to do you're going to project out a lot so you're going to measure the distance from the tip of your toe so basically stand behind the line and then the furthest point back where you land so basically the worst possible score not the best possible because your feet won't land symmetrically ones probably going to be a little bit farther now technically if you fall backwards and your hand touches the ground we mark that number but in this case just use the furthest point back of your back heel go from there I'll be trying it tomorrow morning now if you have access to a little bit more technology or you just really want to know a better number a classic vertical jump is a good starting place so you can actually do this in a simple cost freeway you can just measure two of your hands put them together so that both of your middle fingers are touching overlap them and put them directly over your head okay and then you kind of reach up as high as you can get and you mark that on the wall my brother not used to do this all the time we would take a highlighter the yellow ones and color as much as we can on our fingertips touch the wall so that the highlight of it staying the wall if you actually go back to my house and for my childhood you'll see these markers all over our house I'm sure parents were thrilled my dad didn't care single day didn't care this is like whatever you guys do it everyone so you want to measure that and then of course you're going to jump with those two hands and touch as high as you can up and you're going to measure the distance between your standing reach and the actual height that you jump there now the reason you're doing it to handed by the way is because if you do one handed you can actually reach pretty high by offsetting your shoulders and now you're getting into differences of you know who has more shoulder mobility who has ability to kind of get up there a two foot stand or a two handed standard approach is there same thing no running approach here you can dip you can drive you can do all those things you can swing your arms but you're going to be a two handed touch as it is a general way to do that and you want to look for a number of something like 24 inches or higher if you're past the age of 50 that number can come down a little bit to closer to 20 and again for females it's going to be ratcheted down about 15% every way to go if you're a middle aged female and you're jumping 20 inches you're in a pretty good spot you're going to be looking really nice there so now if you can do that on a force plate that's even better so these are very basically scales that will go out to multiple digits sometimes five to nine digits passes zero and you're going to stand these things you do the exact same test and these are very interesting because they'll tell you not only how high you jump but they'll tell you how much force you put in the ground they can also tell you how long it took you this is called your rate of force development as well as impulse and speed and a bunch of other stuff which are important to help you understand where on the power spectrum you need to be so you would do that in addition to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell so a very classic thing to do would be let's say you're going to do a squat and you're going to put this device on the barbell and that's going to measure the speed which the barbell moves and you're going to do that at 40% of your one-up petition max 50% 60% 70 89 new up to 100 and that allows you to create what's called a force velocity curve and you can start to see at what point when you start loading things heavy you start slowing down too much and that'll tell you what part of the force velocity curve that you want to train to opt for power why that's important a lot of people will do things like when I'm training for power how heavy should I lift well the general answer people say is 30% of your one-up max but that's actually not true at all what's most optimal for power development which will discuss more much later is depending on where your flawed and the force velocity curve so if you have access to technology like that that can give you a lot more insight information if not do the broad jump test or the highlighter on your fingertips so you can see that the highlighter on your fingertips and jump it up to the wall test at Andy Yalpin's house hey just you know I come along there's already the walls are already messed up just go ahead come up to Washington and we'll do it fantastic what about strength right so strength is really important you need to measure this in a in multiple areas and we'll start off with grip strength okay so you can do this in two ways you can buy a hand grip dynamometer now these are anywhere between $100 anywhere this is actually used to be like when I was in school like hundreds of dollars and now you can literally buy them on any website for 25 bucks so my last recommendation is technically that's not cost-free I know your whole thing about the cost-free protocols but 25 bucks I'm calling that basically cost-free you can bring that in a test and that's just a little device where you're going to squeeze and you're going to do and I would do your right hand and your left hand you want to look for asymmetries there but you want to look for something like typically those are they're going to give you a value in kilo grams and you want to look for something like a minimum score here of 40 kilo grams ideally you're up past 60 would be a really good spot to be in you want to make sure that there's no less than 10% variation between your left and right hand your non-dominant hand actually shouldn't be that much weaker in this test so what you'll actually see a lot of times is the non-dominant can be oftentimes stronger because the dominant hand is more for movement precision and writing things like that so you want them to be close if you are a male and you're under 40 kilograms on a hand grip dynamometer like we're gonna need to train that if you're a female it's not that much slower but about 35 kilograms is the cutoff point if you're above 55 we can add it to your training but I'm not worried about leaving it out of your training if you're a female if it's about 50 that's my sort of cutoff where we want to go so that's a fairly cheap one another one that you can actually do is just a dead hang so you can hold on to any bar ideally one that is thin enough to where you can wrap your whole hand around it so you don't want to be using a giant fat grip you're gonna have a false reading here so something like going to the gym and jumping on any pull-up bar or pull-up rack and you want to hang and this is a simple time test so in general we should be able to hang for a minimum of 30 seconds as what we're looking for 30 to kind of 50 seconds is my like good but we could probably get better here if you're cruising above 60 seconds I'm generally pretty happy this is actually a good example of when females tend to be better grip strength and women is tends to be strong and they can hang for quite a long time so those those standards don't really change that much for women now if you are exceptionally large this thing doesn't scale perfectly you know if you're 240 pounds and even if you're lean it's just hard to hang and hold 240 pounds conversely if you're 140 pounds even if you're unhealthy you're gonna be able to hang for a long time that's just not that much weight so just rough numbers has to start off with so that's grip strength what about strength elsewhere in the body the primary ones you can do an upper body strength test if you would like although it's not technically something we do very often happy to do it one on max bench press or something like that that's great the more one I'm generally more interested in is a leg extension test and the reason I like this is a back squat is better a barbell back squat is look that's my like that's my jam that's my life right it's just very technically demanding and it's challenging you need spotters you need comfort a lot goes into this so for the average person a leg extension test is fairly standardized you don't have to worry about technique and people can just get into it and go and so what you want to look for there is is a couple of standards you want to hit again a very simple answer here is body weight can you do a leg extension with your body weight how one repetition one repetition I can answer that right now can you know you can no I can hack squat a reasonable amount of weight but I was on the leg extension this morning and I was a nautilus machine machine and I certainly could not like extension my body weight let me let me clarify where you doing a single leg no so by louder you can't like a sense your body weight no but I certainly can hamstring curl my body weight okay so we maybe have some deficiencies in our quads that we need to go after here but that's a pretty good number you want to be at if you go up an age past age 40 every decade that can come down about 10% and you'll still be in a pretty good slot so if you're 50 years old and you're 170 pounds if you can do 160 year to pretty good sort of spot and then you can just again take it down about 10% every decade after 40 but prior to 40 there's really no change in strength but certainly somebody in their 40s to 50s should be able to leg extension their body weight noted I look forward to our discussion a bit later talking about how to build strength any of these strengths tests they don't have to be done to a technical true one rep max you can use what are called repetition conversion equation so put on a load that you think is kind of close to your maximum and just do it for as many reps as you can as long as it's under five reps total you can then actually go online and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere and it will tell you okay you did three repetitions of 200 pounds your one rep max is probably 215 whatever so there's estimate equations so if you don't want to spend the time or you're not truly comfortable like absolutely going to your true one or max just get to a number that's fairly close and do as many as you can and then go online again one rep max estimator equations are everywhere if you get past five repetitions or so the accuracy of those equations starts going down so don't put on something and go I did 12 reps of it and then try to figure out where your one or max it'll get close you start moving past that you're just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy so I want to make sure whether you're doing the leg extension test or a front squat test you don't technically have to do it an absolute one rep max if neither of those are an option another one I like a lot here is simply a front squat or goblet squat hold so you're going to hold away in front of your chest whether a kettlebell is this great here a dumbbell is fine here and you want to hold about half of your body weight go all the bottom position and try to hold that for about 45 seconds so it's it's a pretty good indicator of number one your position it's hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load as well as core strength and low back stability so it's a very different indicator then say the like extension test but it's a really nice one so it doesn't require many moving parts it's more difficult than leg extension but it's it's quite a bit more functional and it's going to give insight into a lot more areas than just the quadriceps so 45 seconds down at the bottom of the squat and then returning to a standing position yep and if you can't do the return I actually I'm not that worried but as long as you can hold that good position without a technical breakdown in that 45 seconds that's a really good spot as an intro I want a third of your body weight from 30 seconds terrific I plan to attempt all of those strength tests very soon what about hypertrophy sure actually before we get into that I want to jump back really quickly it's important to add a couple of caveats to the strength training stuff so there's two that I want to do number one these are assuming you are technically proficient so I don't want you to do any exercise to exhaustion or to maximum strength if you're not comfortable with your technique so adjust these accordingly if you're not comfortable with the front squat do the leg extension if you're not uncomfortable with that do something different so we never want to utilize maximum testing if it's going to come with a consequence of serious secured injury so that's the most important flag the second one is your warm up protocol will have a huge effect on your actual results and so whenever you do these tests especially if you're going to do a test then a test again down the line you want to make sure that that warm up protocol is standardized now again the NSCA and I can we can I can give you resources has specific guides for exactly what to do for your warm up protocol prior to one max testing so we can go there and you can look that stuff up we can add that to show notes or something yeah and I think when we get into a deeper discussion about strength and hypertrophy and resistance training in general if we get touch into the the best warm up protocol I know I have mine and I'm certain it's going to be sub optimal based on everything maybe that's called based on every conversation we've ever had where I learn all the things I'm doing incorrectly but I do make changes on the basis of what you tell me it's not incorrectly so much as it is like sub optimal that's a very kind way of telling me it's incorrect thank you what about hypertrophy so the thing you want to pay attention to here is you have the aesthetic portion of hypertrophy that's entirely up to you there is no rationale you can decide what you feel like looks good or doesn't look good that's irrelevant there is a sufficient amount you need to have where below that is detrimental to your health regardless of your outcomes and so the best way to do this is a couple of ways any sort of body composition test it can do this so whether this is a scan they're like a Dexascan which is a gold standard or other ways of biological biological impedance or other ways so there's a ton of different tests you can get that are pretty close okay so what you want to pay attention to when you get like a Dexascan is a number called FFMI and so that stands for fat free mass index so you can look at again any number of online calculators these are all standard so it doesn't actually matter where you pull them up you don't have to worry about looking it up and whether or not it's right or not or something and so that's going to actually tell you if you have sufficient muscle math and so a number you want to look for in general something like if you're a man your FFMI should be something like 20 or higher if you're a woman you want to look for something like 18 so that that that's the targets if you get past like 24 25 for a man that's a lot of muscle mass assuming you're reasonably lean now if your FFMI is like 24 25 but your body fat is like 40% you're actually just a very very large individual you're not like you're not in a gray spot so when we say these sort of numbers it's the assumption that you're probably sub 30% body fat for a man and sub 35 for a woman so those the numbers there are online calculators all you really need to know is your total body weight your body fat percentage and then your height you can enter those three numbers and then they'll tell you your FFMI scoring it'll correct for an adjusted value and most of those will actually tell you the grading rubric and then it's a good average bad et cetera but those are the numbers we look at if you are as a man sub 17 as a woman sub 15 now we're in an area of of pretty severe physiological detriment for insufficient muscle and some of our later discussion will talk about why that matters so that's not sub 17% body fat this is specifically the FFMI that's the correct yeah what about muscular endurance is this where you're going to tell me I need to do wall sits so this is really nice you can do any number of tests here a standard plank is a good testament of of musk and so can you hold a front plank for 60 seconds can you hold a side plank for 45 seconds pretty easy if you're able to do a push up so if you can't that sort of tells you loan it's actually interesting if you can't do a single push up that's not a musk endurance issue that's actually now a strength issue because that's a one right max problem so we want to be able to do for again for a general male we should have no problem doing 25 plus consecutive push ups I apologize for interrupting you but as long as we're talking about push ups you just mentioned form are we talking chest touching the ground elbows breaking right angles what is a proper push up according to your laboratory unless you have a very specific reason to limit range of motion I want all my testing done through a full joint range of motion this is different for the person so it's individualized to them but in general for a push up this would be a full complete lockout of the elbows on the top and a full chest touch or close to it at the ground you can do it different it doesn't really matter but just keep it standard from your pre test your post-test if you're trying to mark progress okay but for us unless we have a very specific reason we're going full range of motion for all these tests so 25 push up for a male is a standard and even something like ten is a number we're looking for again it's kind of minimum categories for an upper body muscular endurance and not to get too down in the weeds but I have observed other people of course never myself no I'm kidding but observed other people pausing at maybe at repetition 15 catching their breath and then continuing or you that would be like a like a piston that would be a failed test no pauses correct just up down up down and trying to hit at least 10 but ideally 25 I learned this lesson in one of our studies probably nine years ago where we didn't clarify that and so we actually had an individual he wasn't there wasn't he wasn't being nefarious he just figured out if I do a couple take a quick break into a cup he like quadrupled his post test results from his pre test result because he figured out that little hack there so you want to standardize it it's not that I'm against or have some sort of strong belief is just trying to keep protocol standardized and which means any break failed test so 10 to 25 push-ups minimum for males what about for females so if it's sub 10 for a man that's again in your like very severe red flag problem we really really like to see a number above 25 okay that that's where we're anchoring anything between 10 and 25 is like yeah but not severe it means they have work to do we have work to do and for and for females for a female you're going to scale that sort of back so female the answer could be is little is zero right so you're going to see that can you do a full position if they're in that position we're generally not going to do a muscular endurance test from the knees we we already know the answer is you're zero and we'll actually default to another test which I'll talk about in a second here so for those those folks anything that's going to scale down a little bit right so basically you're looking at 15 is that marker like 25 was for the male where I want to see above 15 and if I do we're good anything between 5 to 15 is a number of like okay if you're sub 5 like we generally have some problems and if that is different between 1 and 0 then like now we zero is is a problem so we should be able to do that so if a female cannot do 10 full push ups yeah 10 full push ups is hard for a female depending on size okay let's say a female can't do 5 full push ups you said rather than go to a knees down version yeah what would you do to assess their muscular endurance and would you then also encourage them to work on their strength well absolutely so again if they can't do they can do anything less in three you're going to be strength in fact if you want to look at muscular endurance in general so this is a bit of an off topic but I promise I'll keep it short and I'll come right back when I was a doctoral student I had two lab mates one of them was a runner female 120 pounds something like that small and the one was a male and he was basically like a straight bro like he lifts weights doesn't do any other sort of training does like a very classic not training program but kind of training and they were sort of bandering back and forth for a while and basically she was saying you're so unfit you can't run it all and he's saying you're so weak you can't do a pull up and so they challenge each other to a competition they said at the end of the year the girl is going to do 26 pull ups and the guy had to run a marathon so 26 miles so that was the thing and then there was some sort of consequence for whoever sort of failed until the guy quickly tried to figure out how the hell am I going to run 26 miles when I have not run a mile in like many, many years so he just started running you know three miles four miles or whatever she well of course they both of them ran immediately to me right and then she was like how the hell I can't do a pull up and I was like great and I gave her a very specific maximal strength protocol and she was like whoa I want to go to the assisted pull up machine and work on doing like sets of 25 because I've got to get my muscular endurance up and I try to explain her your muscular endurance is irrelevant if you can't do one it's never going to matter she did the muscular endurance protocol the entire thing didn't listen to me the end of the year came and she still produced exactly zero pull ups so point is if you look at muscular endurance where is it strength and where is it actually muscular endurance the general sort of number that you're looking for is under like 80 percent all right that's going to tell you is this a muscular endurance problem or is this an absolute strength problem under 80 percent of the one repetition maximum yep so what I mean by that is this in fact this actually is a near question the other way to assess muscular endurance is take the exact strength test you did from the talk five minutes ago what what did you do load that to 75 percent and then do that for as many repetitions as you can and that is a tremendous brawmutter of muscular endurance so if you were able to do 200 pounds in your leg extension test put 75% on that and do that as many repetitions you can you want to look for more than eight repetitions if you are below eight repetitions then we have a muscular endurance problem if it is higher than that if you got 15 or 20 then we know we have probably some problems in your peak strength or the test itself so that is a good eight to 12 sort of number is where you want to be looking at for there what about anaerobic capacity this one's more challenging you either have to go to a laboratory and do something like a wind gate test so this is a 30 second maximal test where you're going to see how much work can you possibly do in that 30 seconds if you don't have a loud assist to laboratory you can you can do this on any any protocol you want you this could be sprinting this can be on a like an air bike this could be on a roar anything like that anything where you can exert maximal effort and you don't have to worry about technical problems so I generally don't like to do things like a kettlebell swing or something like that there's just too many other variables you need to be able to go hardest you possibly can knowing you're going to get to a place of tremendous fatigue now in the lab we often use what's called a Bosco protocol and you're going to stand on a force plate and you're going to do as many vertical jumps as fast as you can as high as you can for 60 seconds and you're absolutely destroyed by like second 45 so we either use that wind gate protocol or that Bosco protocol if you want though again take any of those other places 30 seconds or so up to 45 seconds up to minute if you want it doesn't really matter and you just mark down the distance you cover that's all you we don't really have standards for these things because it's going to be different how far you can travel in 30 seconds on a treadmill is it's going to be so different than sprinting in the field or on the assault bike or whatever so what you really want to worry about there is can you complete it and then how awful do you feel afterwards so what what you really want to think about here is not those protocols but this you want to think about can you get close to your predicted maximum heart rate so the the number we throw out is 220 minus your age so if you're 50 years old 220 minus 50 you should be able to get to a maximum heart rate of around 170 beats per minute now that number is extremely generic if you don't get there that doesn't have any indication of your fitness if you get higher that doesn't mean you're any more fit it's just a rough number so here's what I want you to do in this case your heart rate recovery is the better metric so I want you to get up to a maximum heart rate and then test your heart rate recovery and what you should be looking for there is about half a beat recovery per second so you're going to get up to a second where you reach like absolute terrible exhaustion maximum fatigue test your heart rate and then count right have a time or going within 60 seconds you should have again that half a beat per second you should have a heart rate recovery of 30 beats per minute within the next the next minute so two minute recovery should be in half that so 60 beats those are rough numbers to go by and your three minute recovery is again half of that again so that is the closest way if your heart rate recovery is worse than that then we know we have a problem in your anaerobic capacity or your cardiovascular capacity I love it what about number eight maximum heart rate because what you just describe sounds a lot like maximum heart rate so this is your VO2 max so the goal standard here is to actually go into a laboratory and get this thing done so we can actually run a VO2 max test where you put a mask on collect all your gases and run you to there and there's a very specific protocol for completion of a true maximum test and any any of the scientists will know that if you don't have access to that you can do a couple of tests one of them is called a 12-minute Cooper test so this is simply time you're going to run for 12 minutes as far as you can and you're going to record the distance you covered again you can go online to any any number of calculators enter that distance in and that will tell you your proximal or estimated VO2 max so that's a 12-minute sprint 12-minute sprint maximum distance you can cover in 12 minutes keeping a steady pace the whole time we're going do whatever you want the goal is to get maximum distance covered in 12 minutes so that's anywhere between a mile to two plus miles bang how fat you are but you just do that Cooper 12-minute test got it I told you all right so if you remember a robot capacity is eight to 12 sort of minutes where you're going to see a real true test of that VO2 max you simply can't get that in under a few minutes so it is a is a if you want you can do a little gentler version of that so there are a number of sub-maximal tests there in fact there is a one mile walk test you can do so again all you're going to do is in this case you have to have some sort of either a stopwatch or ideally a heart rate monitor and all you have to do is this is a rockboard one mile sub-maximal test so you're going to walk a mile record the time record your heart rate at the end enter those in and those will give you again estimates of your VO2 max so that's the like oh my gosh I can't run for 12 minutes as hard as I possibly can or I don't want to do it or we have a lot of these in our executive program it's like my knee hurts too bad I've got back pain when I run or whatever can I okay and you do the walk this and it's pretty accurate if you do it correctly so technically all you have to actually do is measure your heart rate on your you know you can count 60 seconds but it's just easier to work with everyone's watches and stuff now just wear a heart rate monitor plug in those numbers and again those are all standard calculations so anywhere you find those you don't have to worry about the source so you just enter your stuff and they're going to be running out the same equation I like the idea of the 12-minute run I'm going to give it a shot so we did for years we did a one mile version of this and there's just a lot more science on the Cooper 12-minute Cooper test so we did that it's pretty good and it is not even remotely close to fun it sounds like fun for other reasons yeah yeah well it is it we're fun in the sense that it reveals a lot yeah powerful potent super there's no hiding you can hide with a legacy in test it doesn't hurt that pad but you you cannot feel anything but the 12-minute run as far as you can test so these are really actually psych psychiatric diagnostic tests they are of source sure number nine long duration steady state yeah exercise I think of this as a K a endurance but as you mentioned before there are other forms of endurance so long duration steady state exercise yep so you really want to think about this as not a standard number this is you should maintain consistent work output for over 20 plus minutes okay and this one I want you to just pick something that it was in your lifestyle so is there a loop around your house that you can do is there some protocol that you like to use before and you're simply going to test your ability can you maintain work without stopping that's all it needs to be now ideally I personally like to throw a little twist in here which is can you do this with nasal breathing only that's when I feel really good if you can go 30 straight minutes without needing to take a break walking doesn't really cut it unless you're very very unfit in which case if walking 30 minutes without a break is a challenge okay like there but if you can I want you moving at a non walking pace I don't care what zone this is two three four five I don't care show me you can maintain minimum of 20 minutes of work with no breaks no interval is no downtime and again ideally breathing through your nose only I love this list but it worries me a bit not because any one of these tests is necessarily that overwhelming but because I'm unclear about how to arrange performance of these different tests yeah for instance do I separate them so I'm doing one test like long duration output on one day and I'm doing strength on another day those seem pretty obvious to me but are there ones that one can combine on different days how much time should one give oneself in between these tests and how often should one do an assessment just as we don't want to necessarily evaluate body weight changes by getting on the scale three times a day maybe once a day at the same time each day is more practical how often should we be assessing our fitness for each and every one of these well the way that I would say this is you want to pick the one that is the worst and do that more frequently so if for example you do the upper body strength test and you are fantastic if you can bench press double your body weight I don't need to test your bench very often for the average person not a power after like maybe once a year or maybe not even that we just don't need to get there however if we then test your your VO2 max and in your 12 minutes you cover a total of a half a mile then like we might want to test that every month right and so we're going to let our priorities emphasize which one we're going to do more often I would recommend doing this full battery once a year full battery mean the entire list on one day the entire not on one day but within a week so you could take a week now you could do these technically all in two days three days split here is probably best so if you were to just say hey this is like testing week I actually love this for beginning of the year or whenever it is you sort of change your training but I think once a year just like once a year you should probably go to a physician and get full blood work a full you know heart scan and everything like that and then if maybe you had a hard issue they would come back and test you more frequently whatever the cases right you should probably run through this and you're going to be thinking of yeah but I don't want to like give up on my exercise routine that week well I promise you you're not going to finish this week and think I didn't do very much work this week it's it's going to feel great and then you're going to have a very nice parameter of exactly where you need to change and and prioritize your training for the next quarter or half a year or wherever you want to go if you want to actually do this every six months that's really we end up actually doing this quite honestly like more like every six months as a general test that's a really good way to do but if minimum if if you're arguing with me give me once a year you want to do this so which order to do them in the non-feteking test you can do whenever so this is the the body composition scan the FMI the body fat composition all this stuff can be done wherever I generally like to do that though as you're very first activity the reason is we know that acute exercise can heavily influence things like body composition measurements because of inflammation water storage etc so it's easiest to just sort of get that off of a 48 hour rest you want to make sure you don't do any hard exercise the day before a body composition test and probably 48 hours before that so just start yourself off with that your movement test can be the same thing you don't want to try to do a assessment of how well you're squatting if you're incredibly sore from your your brutal squatting test so tend to do those things when you're the most fresh then what you want to do is any skill or maximum strength or power goes at the very beginning of the day any fatiguing thing happens at the end and so you could easily do this all right I'm going to do my power test my broad jump great you're not going to be fatigued at all from that and on the same day since I'm already pretty warmed up now I'm going to roll right into my leg strength test and since I'm really warmed up I'm going to do my leg muscular endurance test right there so this is a very common strategy we use we do our one-up max leg extension five minutes seven minutes whatever we need to do come back low to 75% do as many reps as you can boom you could roll right into the your upper body test or your grip strength test or anything else that you want to do there is there a little bit of influence yeah but really for most people it's not that bad what I'm influenced I mean if you do a leg strength test coming back and doing that upper body strength test afterwards it's not that big a deal give yourself 15 give yourself 20 minutes keep it plenty of time so you can knock out your strength testing in muscular endurance testing all in one day that could be you could do your performance your skill diagnostic your power jump test your strength and your most endurance and all that stuff is knocked out you're going to have to come back on a separate day and do your anaerobic test this is 30 seconds maximum endurance things like that you could though if you wanted do that after your long duration test your long duration test is again is just going to function as like a a big warm up or you could flip those things or you could do them on separate days you're going to have to do your real to max test on its own day for the most part unless you wanted to do again your movement or your body composition sort of before those things so you really have the ability to kind of mix and match ideally this most realistically probably takes three days if you want to separate them into four or five the more separation you do the better data you're going to get is just a question of like how how pedantic are you really trying to get here and are you willing to lose 5% to then save a whole day then you can do sort of these things in multiple stacks so that's that's how I would break up so what I'm hearing is better to do it than to not do it most definitely and be rational don't don't try and do your strength output late in the day when you're fatigued you know if you're going to combine some of the steady state endurance and maximum heart rate fine understand there might be a slight deficit there but test it the same way each time and what you're really looking for is improvement. Yep and you could also do the heart rate recovery under any modality so you could do the heart rate recovery after you're able to max as well so you finish that thing and then just you know again do the same tests for up to three minutes. These are fantastic tools I'm almost tempted to say that I'm willing to post my numbers but that actually violates the sort of core principle that I think we're getting out here which is that it's highly unlikely that anybody is going to be phenomenal across the board I mean certainly there will be individuals that are but based on everything we talked about earlier specificity of training and how extensively somebody has been training a certain way will without question. Lopsided them if you will yeah toward being better in some of these assessments and less good in others and that's just simply the way that these adaptations work. Yep and it's not you don't need to be optimal in all these areas to be quote unquote optimal health from this perspective you just want to make sure again there's no severe performance acres is what we call them right we want any of these severe constraints because you're going to get limited by that thing and so what you want to do is move that up to just sufficient or concerning right and get it away from that if you do that that things not going to catch you you're going to be able to continue to pursue pursue optimization in any of the one things that you have a specific passion for which is generally what moves people right you train so that you feel better you train because you know there are all these benefits to it and in to use this audience probably could list hundreds of them but you also train because you generally like to get better at something a lot of us like have something and so you want to make sure that you're not going hey I know you're good at endurance but you really shouldn't train anymore we don't want that message not at all I want you to love your training we just want to make sure that you're not loving that so much that you're not taking some blinders off and missing another area which would actually again you pull that performance anchor this whole ship sales faster with less effort and less friction what I love about this is also that as you've described it it's not just for athletes or people that are super into fitness it's also for people that just want to be healthy and want aesthetic changes and that's why they're exercising which I think accounts for a really large percentage of people out there so I think what you described is it incredibly well structured incredibly clear and incredibly actionable so I want to thank you for that I'm serious about my willingness to do this and at least share those numbers with you and I think for most people that are seeking what you listed off before aesthetic changes functionality and longevity it's clear that all nine of these are going to be important in some regard or another so before we close out I want to go back and finish off the metrics for Vio2max because I don't actually think I gave you numbers on that so in general for men a minimum number we want to look at here is 35 milliliters per kilogram per minute and for women that be about 30 so we can actually push a lot higher on those things in reality I want to see men above 50 if I could just interrupt you for a second when you say 40 milliliters per kilogram milliliters of what specifically yeah so what actually those metrics mean is the first one milliliters is oxygen so to mount of oxygen kilograms is body weight so it's how much oxygen can you bring in per kilogram of body weight per minute so does a volume of oxygen per your size and a time duration in fact the way that you calculated is you multiply your cardiac output by what's called your AVO2 difference your cardiac output is your heart rate times your stroke volume so how much blood you're pumping out per pump is your stroke volume how many times you're pumping or you're beating you multiply that by your AVO2 difference you have a two difference is artery minus vein difference so it's the amount of oxygen in your arteries minus the amount of oxygen in your vein which is going to tell you how much you took up in your capillaries in your muscles so you take those two factors multiply them together and there's your Vio2max you know as you were describing that I imagine you getting to an FM machine and seeing that equation lighting up in your brain because clearly it's committed to memory very well thank you for that clear description yeah so to finish those numbers I really truly want to see some a man above 50 and I'm not even really stoked until I get about 55 in fact it's sort of funny Dave Costell whose lab I did my PhD and he was retired by the time but he's again one of these legendary figures in exercise physiology I'm starting the 70s he would always say there's no human excuse to be below 60 which I was always like damn like that's really actually pretty hard to get to it was he was he oh yeah he's still actually setting world records like in these last couple of years in his like all the master's record for swimming and cycling and stuff so he was a super super fit guy so he was always above 60s probably like 50 something now even though he's you know 80 or whatever 80 years old yeah with the Vio2max of 50 he's probably really not 50s probably but he's probably going to remember that earlier in the we talked about I had the 92 year old the Vio2max of 38 Dave's probably going to break that record when he gets there I'm sure I'm sure I get in fact I guarantee you he has that number in his brain I haven't talked to him in 15 years but I guarantee you that number is in his brain and he's probably training for it I love it and I love it because it proves that exercise pays off oh yeah it's one of the few things in life where there's a direct relationship between work and outcome yeah that's as Henry Rollins described in his wonderful essay if you're familiar with that oh my gosh you're a punk rock guy you know Henry I'm sure I mean I certainly know who he is and I know his he has work an incredible one page paper sort of something to do with the iron and he basically describes that as like this is the one thing where it's truth like it is the most true thing you'll ever do which is I love for that it's almost like a principle of a nature 100% yeah so with with the women I really want to see the women if I want to see men above 55 I really want to see women above 50 as the target and if you like you're there I'm pretty good so you can do the math on then the middle ground if what's like okay but we need to work on it in fact if you look across the literature at different athletes you're going to see like the the really high level endurance folks you know they may pass 70 or 80 in fact there was talk a few years ago of a guy breaking a hundred that's like an 18 or 19 year old but I actually don't think it was ever fully confirmed or repeated but certainly you'll see plenty of people like 95 in those extremes if you look at other sports like football or basketball they're probably going to be in the 55 65 sort of range so if you as an average person or 55 that's a really good marker to be in if you get even close to that you're at a good spot I'm sorry I'm not going to let you down Dave. I just love how you're describing this average person you're looking me with just a little bit of sympathy like like if you if you reach the standard of average Andrew listen you're giving me prompts all over the place to try and improve my metrics whatever they happen to be and I think that's one of the great values of getting objective numbers even if they have to be measured by some of these back of the envelope techniques that you know I guess we always teach people in the laboratory right that a tool can be not extremely precise but as long as it's reliable of course there is still value there I mean of course you'd love to have the most precise and most reliable tool but if you can't then at least go for a reliable tool and measure for consistency yet for the real world reliability beast validity as much as we can for a lot of things we're talking about especially for using it as a metric of did I get better as long as that tool is reliable body composition just all these things have inherent error in them some of them are smaller some of them are larger but as you mentioned having standardization within the testing protocol is going to allow you to measure progress and that's going to tell you so we're at now that we sort of covered all the these areas of adaptation we walk through the history and we walk through a bunch of the explanations for why people are maybe not getting the results that they want to get through their training the way I would like to go with the rest of our conversations would be to just go through each of those adaptations step by step and make sure I cover very specific protocols for if you have run through this testing and identified an area of weakness so maybe you've sort of been lifting a lot because you like lifting and you maybe realize that your cardiovascular fitness or your heart rate of recovery is not where it really should be or the opposite like we've talked about maybe you're doing a lot of that type of work and your strength isn't there your movement quality is not there so you've identified a problem how do I specifically solve it what are the evidence based and most effective protocols that I can put myself in for each one of these categories and I think that would give people a lot of take home value but it's going to take us some time to cover so it's going to have to come across over multiple conversations between you and I. Great well I'm looking forward to each and all of those conversations and I want to add just one more metric to our discussion today which is really just my way of saying thank you because if there were a metric for amount of useful information, percentage spoke you would be at the upper level of that metric you have this amazing ability to provide so much knowledge in a clear and concise and today listed out format that is both interesting grounded in science and actionable so on behalf of everyone listening and certainly for myself as well I just want to say thank you well I appreciate the compliments and I'm looking forward to the next conversation jumping right into speed strength and I purchase retraining and what the evidence based and best practices for protocols in those areas if you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our YouTube channel that's a terrific zero cost way to support us in addition please subscribe to the podcast on Spotify and Apple and on both Spotify and Apple you can leave us up to a five star review if you have questions for us or comments or suggestions about topics you'd like us to cover or guess you'd like me to include on the Hubertman Lab podcast please put those in the comments section on YouTube we do read all the comments please also check out the sponsors mentioned at the beginning and during today's episode that's the best way to support this podcast I'd also like to inform you about the Hubertman Lab podcast free newsletter it's called the neural network newsletter and each month the neural network newsletter is sent out and it contains summaries of podcast episodes specific protocols discussed on the Hubertman Lab podcast all unfairly concise format and all completely zero cost you can sign up for the neural network newsletter by going to Hubertman Lab.com go to the menu and click on newsletter you provide us your email we do not share it with anybody and as I mentioned before it's completely zero cost by going to Hubertman Lab.com you can also go into the menu tab and go to newsletter and see some example from months past thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion about fitness exercise and performance with Dr. Andy Galpin and as always thank you for your interest in science
